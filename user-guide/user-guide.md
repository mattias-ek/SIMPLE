# User guide to SIMPLE

## Installing SIMPLE

Simple can be installed using the following command,  

```
pip install simple-chetec
```

You can update to a newer version using,

```
pip install --upgrade simple-chetec
```

**Note:** Use ``import simple`` to import the package once installed.

The SIMPLE package does not come with the database files, these have to be downloaded separately (See below).

## Databases

The database is available separately on zenodo [zenodo.17962171](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17962171).
